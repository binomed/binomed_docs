# Under the hood of DevFest Nantes CFP

Notes:
Let's see together How we select the talks for DevFest Nantes

##==##

<!-- .slide: data-background="./assets/images/devfest_nantes.jpg" class="transition text-red no-filter"  -->

Notes:
DevFest Nantes is the Biggest DevFest of the world with 18 100 attendees per day, 100 speakers. It's a 2 day event and approximatly 35% of the content in english. As we organise it as a volunteer, it's lots of work and we want to continue to increase the quality of the event.

##==##

<!-- .slide: data-background="./assets/images/mark-duffel-422279-unsplash.jpg" class="transition text-red no-filter"  -->

Notes:
We fix us some rules to be shure to be as fair as we can and to continue to keep our quality

##==##

<!-- .slide: data-background="./assets/images/samuel-zeller-699374-unsplash.jpg" class="transition text-red no-filter"  -->

Notes:
Only one talk per speaker. We try as we can to have diversity in our conference so, a way to promote this is to avoid to have speakers giving more than one talk. Each year we have exception but we try to respect it. So don't waste your time to propose 1000 subjects

##==##

<!-- .slide: data-background="./assets/images/ross-findon-303091-unsplash.jpg" class="transition text-red no-filter"  -->

Notes:
In the same spirit, we try to change every 2/3 years the speakers. If a speaker speaks at our DevFest since 3 years, it's maybe the time to change. Don't be surprise if you are not selected because you where present on previous editions.

Notes:
As organizers, we think it's not fair to be include in the program except for the keynotes. And a litle anecdote. In 2016, I do a kind of breakdown because I have to many things to prepare.

Notes:
So, what's our target ? What do we look at for ?
It's a mix between lots of things.

<!-- .slide: data-background="./assets/images/chayene-rafaela-788075-unsplash.jpg" class="transition text-red no-filter"  -->

Notes:
Baby speaker : Generally as people paid for the event, they expect a minimum level of quality so we usually don't take newbee speakers. Or not in conference track ! We have a track with shorter talks for new speakers

##==##

<!-- .slide: data-background="./assets/images/neonbrand-265876-unsplash.jpg" class="transition text-red no-filter"  -->

Notes:
Experimented speaker : So generaly we search for experimentaed speakers. Also in our process we pre-book somes rockstars speakers that won't never submit subjects in CFP. It's a way for us to garentee our internationnal proportion.


##==##

<!-- .slide: data-background="./assets/images/element5-digital-763867-unsplash.jpg" class="transition text-red no-filter"  -->

Notes:
To help us to deliberate, we give ranks to each talks. This will help us to identify a top best proposals. So what are we looking for ? 


##==##

<!-- .slide: data-background="./assets/images/karim-ghantous-333364-unsplash.jpg" class="transition text-red no-filter"  -->

Notes:
Good Title. The title is important also for us because, when we select a speaker, we want to be sure that the speaker will have attendees in it's room

##==##

<!-- .slide: data-background="./assets/images/aaron-sebastian-705195-unsplash.jpg" class="transition text-red no-filter"  -->

Notes:
No Advertising. We look at the abstract of talk to be shure that the speaker won't use our event to do advertising. It's generally not appreciate by the attendees

##==##

<!-- .slide: data-background="./assets/images/markus-spiske-357131-unsplash.jpg" class="transition text-red no-filter"  -->

Notes:
Technical so we're more looking at technical talks or we search references, articles write by the speaker. To verify that the main motivitation is sharing some content and the passion of technology 


##==##

<!-- .slide: data-background="./assets/images/rawpixel-252130-unsplash.jpg" class="transition text-red no-filter"  -->

Notes:
If the speaker gives us as many informations as he can, it's very happreciate because we will read thoses notes. It will help us to understand what you want to do.

<!-- .slide: data-background="./assets/images/deliberation.png" class="transition text-red no-filter"  -->

Notes:
Finally, we look at the score of each talks and deliberate during an afternoon about the ideal program. As we have a very high number of talks to review (last year it was approximally 500), we only review the talks with score upper to 3 (which let us arround 200 subject to discuss). We separate each talks by category / tracks and proceed category by category to finally select the program :)
